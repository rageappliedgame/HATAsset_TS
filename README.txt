Summary of most important changes in the version 1.2.5 of the TwoA asset:
- Added a calibration phase: during the first 30 games, changes in player and/or scenario ratings are higher due to bigger K factor (this feature is not validated; use with caution)
- Changed the name space for the TwoA asset to "TwoANS"

Summary of most important changes in the version 1.2 of the TwoA asset:
- Added a second Elo-based adaptation module that requires only player accuracy. Accuracy can be any value between 0 and 1.
- Remove dependency on external files. Now it is assumed that the game developer will add scenario and game data programatically instead of storing them in an xml file.
- Extended API for greater flexibitility of managing player and scenario data.
- Added methods to request recommended difficulty rating instead of scenario.
- Added a parameter (K factor) for scaling changes in ratings in reassessment methods.
- Added API for constructing a knowledge structure using difficulty ratings from the TwoA asset. The API also includes methods for converting the knowledge structure into a XML format.
